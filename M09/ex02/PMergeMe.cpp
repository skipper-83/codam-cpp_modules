// I am here because I am mandatory, but the class is imlemented as a template so I am not used.
// Implementing a template class is much harder than writing different functions for each type,
// which was possible because CODAM allows the use of CPP above 98, and hence the use of the Iterator library,
// containing functions like std::distance, std::advance, std::next, std::prev, etc.
// Without these, writing a template class for different container types would be a nightmare.
